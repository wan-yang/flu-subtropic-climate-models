## Study description
Humidity has been shown to affect winter-time influenza epidemics in temperate regions. However, humidity alone is insufficient to explain the bi-annual epidemics observed in tropics and subtropics. In this study, we construct seven models to test the impact of climate drivers under different hypotheses. Using surveillance data collected in Hong Kong, we identify a best-fit model capable of recreating the long-term influenza transmission dynamics observed over 20 years. The best-fit model quantifies how temperature moderates the bimodal effect of humidity on influenza transmission. The best-fit model also generates estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. 

## What is in this repo
